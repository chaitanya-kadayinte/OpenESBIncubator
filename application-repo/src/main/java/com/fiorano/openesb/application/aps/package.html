The <code>com.fiorano.openesb.application.aps</code> package defines a set of <code>DmiObjects</code> that represent a Tifosi Application. A Tifosi Application consists of an application header, service instances, and the routes between them. This package defines <code>ApplicationPropertySheet</code>, which represents a Tifosi Application; and also defines other classes that contain information about an application - <code>ApplicationHeader</code>, <code>ServiceInstance</code>, and <code>Route</code>, for example.
</p>

<p>
This package is used for transferring an application from the Tifosi Enterprise Server to a Tifosi Tool and back, and in saving a new or modified application in the Tifosi Enterprise Server's Application Repository as an XML file. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For transferring the application information over the Messaging Bus Server, the objects are converted to a byte array as the Messaging Bus expects data in byte array format. At the target server, the byte array is converted back to the appropriate DMI object.
