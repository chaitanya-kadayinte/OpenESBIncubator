This package provides a Data Modelling Interface (DMI) for a Fiorano Service. This package defines <code>Service</code> as well as other classes that contain information about the service - <code>Port</code>, <code>Resource</code>, <code>Execution</code>, and <code>Deployment</code>, for example.
</p>

<p>
This package is used in transferring service information from the Fiorano Enterprise Server to a Fiorano Peer Server and from the Fiorano Enterprise Server to a Fiorano Tool.  It is also used in saving a new or modified service in the Fiorano Enterprise Server's Service Repository as an XML file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For transferring the service information over the Messaging Bus Server, the objects are converted to a byte array as the Messaging Bus expects data in byte array format. At the target server, the byte array is converted back to the appropriate DMI object.
