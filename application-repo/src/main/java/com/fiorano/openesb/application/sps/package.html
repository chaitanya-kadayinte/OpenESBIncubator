The <code>com.fiorano.openesb.application.sps</code> package defines a set of <code>DmiObjects</code> that represent a Tifosi Service. This package defines <code>ServicePropertySheet</code> which represents a Tifosi Service; and also defines other classes that contain information about the service - <code>PortDescriptor</code>, <code>Resource</code>, <code>Execution</code>, and <code>Deployment</code>, for example.
</p>

<p>
This package is used in transferring service information from the Tifosi Enterprise Server to a Tifosi Peer Server and from the Tifosi Enterprise Server to a Tifosi Tool.  It is also used in saving a new or modified service in the Tifosi Enterprise Server's Service Repository as an XML file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For transferring the service information over the Messaging Bus Server, the objects are converted to a byte array as the Messaging Bus expects data in byte array format. At the target server, the byte array is converted back to the appropriate DMI object.
