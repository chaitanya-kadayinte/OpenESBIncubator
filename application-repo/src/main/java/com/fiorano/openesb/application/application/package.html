<p>
This package provides a Data Modelling Interface (DMI) for a Fiorano Event Process. A Fiorano Event Process consists of an application header, service instances, and the routes between them. This package defines <code>Application</code> as well as other classes that contain information about an application - <code>ApplicationReference</code>, <code>ServiceInstance</code>, and <code>Route</code>, for example.
</p>

<p>
This package is used for transferring an application from the Fiorano Enterprise Server to a Fiorano Tool and back, and in saving a new or modified application in the Fiorano Enterprise Server's Application Repository as an XML file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For transferring the application information over the Messaging Bus Server, the objects are converted to a byte array as the Messaging Bus expects data in byte array format. At the target server, the byte array is converted back to the appropriate DMI object.
